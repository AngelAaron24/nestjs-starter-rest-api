## NestJS Starter-Kit [WIP]

This starter kit has the following outline:
- Monolithic Project.
- REST API

This is a Github Template Repository, so it can be easily [used as a starter template](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) for other repositories.

## Sample implementations
